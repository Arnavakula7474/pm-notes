## Scrum
    * According to the Scrum Alliance, Scrum is the leading agile development method for completing projects with a complex, innovative scope of work.
    * The term was coined in 1986 in a Harvard Business Review study that compared high-performing, cross-functional teams to the scrum formation used by rugby teams.

## Agile
      Agile means being able to move quickly and easily, but some people feel that project management, as they have seen it used, does not allow people to work quickly or easily
Early software development projects often used a waterfall approach
As technology and businesses became more complex, the approach was often difficult to use because requirements were unknown or continuously changing
Agile today means using an approach where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration
